# mentalray_fisheye_lens

This is a custom Mental Ray shader to simulate a fisheye camera lens.

When attached to the render camera as a custom Mental ray shader it will be used to perturb the light rays passing through the camera lens.

It is a rather simple and straight-forward implementation without any parameters.
